School is a daily routine for us
In the morning, we're sure to make a fuss
Even when the sun is still not up,
Here we are, awake at 6am sharp
</p>

We feel that school is such a bore
We feel that school is such a chore
Parents say, "School's great! Now, go!"
We say, "Well, what do you know?"
</p>
<p>
Late a minute and we have to run
Eyes half open, shoelaces undone
We reach school and we see our friends,
Immediately, the torture ends
</p>
<p>
We have a chat and go with the flow
Then the bell rings, it is time to go
We may at times find school stressful
To have some fun, we have to bend some rules

Talk back to teachers, and detention we serve
No doubt, it is sometimes what we deserve
Sometimes they are as cold as ice
And other times they're actually really nice
</P>
<p>
They teach us and give us a helping hand
They're forever ready to listen and be a friend
They have built much confidence in us
Just not when they are being really harsh
</p>

<p>
Over the years of education,
Never have we had so much learning with action
Such as camps, experiments, concerts and activities
We've learnt so much and even saved the trees
</p>
<p>
A wise teacher once said aloud -
Success is failure turned inside out
So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit
Rest if you must, but don't you quit
</p>
<p>
Some may see school as a torture chamber
Some cannot wait for the holidays in December
But it depends on how we look at school
Honestly, positively, school is cool!
</p>
